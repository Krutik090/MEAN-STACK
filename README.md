# 🌐 MEAN Stack – AngularJS Web App Demo

This is a basic **MEAN stack** project that uses:

- **MongoDB** for the database  
- **Express.js** as the backend framework  
- **AngularJS (1.x)** for the frontend  
- **Node.js** as the server environment

This project is intended for **training and demonstration purposes** to help understand how the original MEAN stack works together to build full-stack web applications.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- AngularJS 1.x frontend with routing and controllers
- RESTful API built with Express.js and Node.js
- MongoDB for data storage (with Mongoose ODM)
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Separation of frontend and backend logic
- Bootstrap for UI styling (if used)

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krutik090/MEAN-STACK.git
cd MEAN-STACK
````

### 2. Setup and Run Backend (Node + Express)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # Configure MongoDB URI and PORT
npm start
```

> Backend runs on `http://localhost:3000` (or as configured)

---

### 3. Run Frontend (AngularJS)

You can run the frontend in any static server:

#### Option A: Use VS Code Live Server Extension

Open `frontend/` and click **Go Live**

#### Option B: Use Python HTTP server

```bash
cd frontend
python3 -m http.server 5500
# visit http://localhost:5500
```

## ✅ Requirements

* Node.js v14+
* MongoDB (local or Atlas)
* A browser that supports AngularJS
* Static file server (Live Server or Python)

---

## 👨‍🏫 Who Is This For?

* Students learning the original MEAN stack
* Developers exploring AngularJS (1.x)
